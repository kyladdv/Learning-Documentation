INPUT A	- T
INPUT B	-T
AND	- T
OR	- T
NAND	- T
NOR - F
					
					
Gates are taking more than 2 inputs but only giving out 1 output 
Power of 2 

GND
Display 1 – b and c 
Inputs = 8 
Outputs = 8 
28 – 256 options 

How the gates are converted 

1996


Binary value 
00 + 11
= 011
0 + 0
= 0 (1 output)
1 + 1 
= 10 (2 outputs)

Decimal Value 
0 + 3
= 3

2 inputs 
Input A and Input B 

If any are 0 = 0 
Any become 1 = 1 
A – XOR gate 
B – AND gate 

k-map – find the lowest amount of logic gates that you can carry out 
don’t confuse power with input 
input is 1 and the output is 1 
P1.0 P1.2 P1.2 P1.3 – Red LED - Input
Green LED – output 

IC - Multiple gates inside 
1 IC – 6 Gates 
1 not working – not all working 
Both don’t affect the output 
IC – Means inside the gates not working – not IC not working 
IC works – CP works – etc. 

0110103 – is it a binary number? False – there is a three PRESENT 
10101? = 21 
Know how to convert one base to another 
K-Map – reduce logic gates 


Combinational Circuits 
•	Outputs depend only on present inputs 
•	Feedback path is not present 
•	Memory elements are not required 
•	Clock signal is not required 
•	Easy to design 
Sequential Circuits 
•	Outputs depend on both present inputs and present 

Flip Flops 
Gates become circuits 
Edge triggered 

Clock signals 


Flowchart 
-	Don’t get confused about states 
o	Powering on computer 
	Press button multiple things are occurring 
-	Human readable 
-	State diagram 
o	State transition 
	State to state 
•	How long you press – on/off or sleep 

Registers 
-	Serial in serial out 
o	Q3 = Q2 = Q1 = Q0 = 0

How the gates useful to solve 
Fundamental understanding of gates to the application 

If there is an error in the signal, then it will appear as red and that means that there was an issue within the gate but does not mean that the entire thing does not work 
If the signal is blue, then the state has been displayed as true
If the signal is white, then the state is not high and is low with a false reading

Different Types of Gates 
1. Basic Gates 
NOT, AND, OR
2. Universal Gates 
NAND, NOR
3. Arithmatic Gates 
X-OR, X-NOR


Truth tables help in understanding all of the logical possibilities
